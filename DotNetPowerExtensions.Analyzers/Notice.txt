In order for the compiler to notice that the analyzer as part of the release, it needs the following:
	- A field of Type DiagnasticDescriptor in the class of the intializer (not a base and not a property)
	- It also has to be initalized with a DiagnasticDescriptor
	- Note that the new() syntax doesn't work only new DiagnasticDescriptor()
	- However the DiagnosticDescriptor so far doesn't appear to have to be references...
If it follows these rules it will report a warning if it is not in the unshipped/shipped files
Otherwise if the diagnostic is references in unshipped it will throw a warning

If the parameters passed to the new DiagnasticDescriptor() are not present in the current file it will throw a warning in some framework versions:
	`CSC : error AD0001: Analyzer 'Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Analyzers.MetaAnalyzers.DiagnosticDescriptorCreationAnalyzer' threw an exception of type 'System.ArgumentException' with message 'Syntax node is not within syntax tree'.`
And in some versions the Analyzer will not be recognized as part of the release
